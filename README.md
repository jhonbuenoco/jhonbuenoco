# About ME ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Developer with 15 years of experience building websites and online businesses. My main areas of expertise are Website Development with Javascript/Typescript/Node.js, WordPress, Woocommerce, SEO, Digital Marketing, and AWS Cloud Computing. I have a very practical approach for each project: information architecture, usability, user experience, and website performance.

Every related issue for having a complete online-based business. From the hosting (shared, VPS, cloud, and system management) to the design, development, and organic search ranking.

I'm passionate about two things in the digital world: Coding and Writing.

I am very passionate about web technologies since I started to work with them. The Internet brings many opportunities for everybody and I love to contribute to the development of web-based projects. Your success is my success too.

I've been an entrepreneur and worked on my own business and freelance projects, so I not only possess the technical knowledge for website development but also the managerial skills for leading a web project. My experience in marketing gives me a deeper insight to embrace the job.

Being involved in different kinds of projects, including client and personal projects, I have known and built several ways to make business in a digital landscape.

I love solving problems and thinking outside the box. I am excited about the opportunity to work with you or your company and help you find the best solution.

Feel free to contact me. I am happy to do business with you.
